OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT
Objectives:
1)Load and Understand the Dataset:
Familiarize with the dataset and its features.
Identify the target variable and features for prediction.
2)Preprocess the Data:
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.
Key Activities:
1) Load and Understand the Dataset:
Load the dataset using a suitable library (e.g., pandas for CSV files, sklearn for built-in datasets).
Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
Examine the dataset for any missing values and the types of features (numeric, categorical).
2. Preprocess the Data:
Handling Missing Values: Decide on a strategy to handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Encoding Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical features.
Normalization/Standardization: Scale the features to ensure they are on a similar scale, if necessary.
